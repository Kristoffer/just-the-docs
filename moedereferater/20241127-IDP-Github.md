Do we need to migrate to EU? 


Github has a possibility to fund migration to Github. Requires some 

Enterprise managed users are a requirement for migrating to EU. "No option and no plan to include the option in EU cloud."

We do not desire to migrate to Enterprise Managed Users and would likely

- Code spaces not available in EU (missing resources in Azure - this might come, but no actual plans)
- Mac runnes are not available as Azure has no Mac data center. And no plans. 
- And Enterprise managed Users are required.

We conclude that we don't want EMUs and should stay in the US.
